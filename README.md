# implicitdiscrimination
This repository contains raw data and all analysis code for the article *Explicit and Implicit Belief-Based Gender Discrimination: A Hiring Experiment*.

## R scripts

R scripts to reproduce all analyses that are presented in the article can be found in the `R` folder. The script `plot_function.R` is a helper script imported into the main script `analysis.R`, which exports all empirical tables (unformatted) and figures into the respective folders. The order of analyses follows the structure of the article. The script contains comments which highlight some results in order to ease orientation. The folder also contains the R session info in the file `session_info.md`.

## Data

In the `data` folder, the file `candidates.xlsx` contains data from the **Job Candidate Assessment**, while the file `hiring.xlsx` contains data from the **Hiring Experiment**. The tables below explain all variables.
